# Cadenza

A local, single-user qualitative data analysis desktop app (Electron + React + TypeScript).

Coding is one lens among several, not the privileged one: codes, lightweight inventory
"items", and freeform notes/memos (optionally structured as an AQA-style question+answer,
per Paillé & Mucchielli) are all first-class ways to work with a segment of text, and a
Cluster can itself *be* an analytic question rather than just a theme label. Whenever text
is coded, memoed, or itemized, the verbatim quote is captured on the spot, so it survives
even if the source document is later edited — and it can be: a per-paragraph inline editor
lets you fix transcription errors or redact names after import, re-anchoring every existing
coding/note automatically. Clusters (a code/note/quote grouping — or itself an analytic
question) are the same data everywhere they appear: the board, the Workspace sidebar's
Clusters tab, and Analysis's Clusters tab are three views onto one list, not three copies to
keep in sync. Every code and note appears on the default board automatically, and clusters
can nest into superordinate groups (drag one into another; shift+drag to pull one back out).
Import/export with Word (.docx), OpenOffice (.odt), and Excel (.xlsx/.xls) rounds it out.

Runs on Windows and macOS. See `\plans\humble-herding-pike.md` for the
full design/phase plan.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev        # launches the app with hot reload
npm run typecheck  # type-checks main + renderer
npm run build      # production build to ./out
npm run build:win  # build + package a Windows installer/portable exe
npm run build:mac  # build + package a macOS dmg/zip (run this on a Mac)
```

## Status

- [x] Phase 0 — Electron + Vite + React + TS scaffold, boots on dev and production build
- [x] Phase 1 — Project persistence (`.qdaproj` create/open/save, autosave)
- [x] Phase 2 — Document import (.docx/.odt/.txt) + reader pane
- [x] Phase 3 — Coding engine (select text → code, codebook hierarchy, merge)
- [x] Phase 4 — Notes/AQA system (question+answer memos, attach-anywhere, promote-to-code)
- [x] Phase 5 — Retrieval (by code/note) + Cluster management (AQA question log)
- [x] Phase 6 — Visual grouping board (drag-and-drop clustering of codes/notes/quotes)
- [ ] Phase 7 — Cross-case comparison (Kaufmann contrastive view, IPA-style GECT table)
- [ ] Phase 8 — Excel import (row=case) + exporters (annotated .docx, .xlsx reports, backup)
- [ ] Phase 9 — Packaging polish (icons, verified Windows + macOS builds)

### Methodology reality-check (2026-09-07)

The app's actual analytic targets are Kaufmann's comprehensive interview analysis, IPA,
Reflexive Thematic Analysis, and AQA. None of the four run end-to-end yet — Phase 5 closes
the two most foundational shared gaps (retrieval, real Category CRUD), but cross-case
comparison (Phase 7) still matters a lot for IPA/RTA specifically, and export/write-up
(Phase 8) matters for all four eventually.

### Board/Workspace unification (2026-09-07)

The board and the Categories view used to be two separate grouping mechanisms (a
`BoardCluster` with its own copied membership, "promoted" once into a `CategoryRecord`) that
could drift out of sync. They're now the same data: a cluster is a category's spatial shape
on a given board, with no separate membership or promotion step — see `boardOps.ts` and
`categoryOps.ts`. Categories can also nest (`parentCategoryId`, mirroring `CodeNode.parentId`),
surfaced on the board as dragging one cluster into another. Every code and note is visible
on the one default board automatically; other boards stay opt-in/curated, with bulk
"add all codes/notes/clusters" actions for quickly populating one.

### Terminology + Workspace clusters tab (2026-09-07)

User-facing text now says "cluster" everywhere this concept appears (Board, Analysis,
Workspace), rather than mixing "category"/"cluster"/"theme". The underlying type stays
`CategoryRecord`/`categoryOps.ts` internally — renaming it would have collided with the
already-distinct `BoardCluster` (a category's per-board position, not the category itself).
The Workspace sidebar gained a third tab, Clusters, rendering the exact same `ClustersView`
component Analysis uses — one component, one data source, so a cluster created from the
board, the Workspace tab, or the Analysis tab is the same record everywhere, never a copy
that needs to be kept in sync. (The separate `NoteCategoryDef` concept — Note Descriptive/
Linguistique/Conceptuelle classification tags — intentionally keeps the word "category":
it's a genuinely different thing, a flat per-note tag, not a grouping cluster.)
