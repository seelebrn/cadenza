# Cadenza

A local, single-user qualitative data analysis desktop app (Electron + React + TypeScript).

Coding is one lens among several, not the privileged one: codes, lightweight inventory
"items", and freeform notes/memos (optionally structured as an AQA-style question+answer,
per Paillé & Mucchielli) are all first-class ways to work with a segment of text, and a
Cluster can itself *be* an analytic question rather than just a theme label. Whenever text
is coded, memoed, or itemized, the verbatim quote is captured on the spot, so it survives
even if the source document is later edited — and it can be: a per-paragraph inline editor
lets you fix transcription errors or redact names after import, re-anchoring every existing
coding/note automatically. Clusters (a code/note/quote grouping — or itself an analytic
question) are the same data everywhere they appear: the board, the Workspace sidebar's
Clusters tab, and Analysis's Clusters tab are three views onto one list, not three copies to
keep in sync. Every code and note appears on the default board automatically, and clusters
can nest into superordinate groups (drag one into another; shift+drag to pull one back out).
Import/export with Word (.docx), OpenOffice (.odt), and Excel (.xlsx/.xls) rounds it out.

Runs on Windows and macOS. See `\plans\humble-herding-pike.md` for the
full design/phase plan.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev        # launches the app with hot reload
npm run typecheck  # type-checks main + renderer
npm run build      # production build to ./out
npm run build:win  # build + package a Windows installer/portable exe
npm run build:mac  # build + package a macOS dmg/zip (run this on a Mac)
```

## Status

- [x] Phase 0 — Electron + Vite + React + TS scaffold, boots on dev and production build
- [x] Phase 1 — Project persistence (`.qdaproj` create/open/save, autosave)
- [x] Phase 2 — Document import (.docx/.odt/.txt) + reader pane
- [x] Phase 3 — Coding engine (select text → code, codebook hierarchy, merge)
- [x] Phase 4 — Notes/AQA system (question+answer memos, attach-anywhere, promote-to-code)
- [x] Phase 5 — Retrieval (by code/note) + Cluster management (AQA question log)
- [x] Phase 6 — Visual grouping board (drag-and-drop clustering of codes/notes/quotes)
- [ ] Phase 7 — Cross-case comparison (Kaufmann contrastive view, IPA-style GECT table)
- [ ] Phase 8 — Excel import (row=case) + exporters (annotated .docx, .xlsx reports, backup)
- [ ] Phase 9 — Packaging polish (icons, verified Windows + macOS builds)

### Methodology reality-check (2026-09-07)

The app's actual analytic targets are Kaufmann's comprehensive interview analysis, IPA,
Reflexive Thematic Analysis, and AQA. None of the four run end-to-end yet — Phase 5 closes
the two most foundational shared gaps (retrieval, real Category CRUD), but cross-case
comparison (Phase 7) still matters a lot for IPA/RTA specifically, and export/write-up
(Phase 8) matters for all four eventually.

### Board/Workspace unification (2026-09-07)

The board and the Categories view used to be two separate grouping mechanisms (a
`BoardCluster` with its own copied membership, "promoted" once into a `CategoryRecord`) that
could drift out of sync. They're now the same data: a cluster is a category's spatial shape
on a given board, with no separate membership or promotion step — see `boardOps.ts` and
`categoryOps.ts`. Categories can also nest (`parentCategoryId`, mirroring `CodeNode.parentId`),
surfaced on the board as dragging one cluster into another. Every code and note is visible
on the one default board automatically; other boards stay opt-in/curated, with bulk
"add all codes/notes/clusters" actions for quickly populating one.

### Terminology + clusters inside the codebook tab (2026-09-07)

User-facing text now says "cluster" everywhere this concept appears (Board, Analysis,
Workspace), rather than mixing "category"/"cluster"/"theme". The underlying type stays
`CategoryRecord`/`categoryOps.ts` internally — renaming it would have collided with the
already-distinct `BoardCluster` (a category's per-board position, not the category itself).

Cluster creation/management lives in the Workspace's existing "Codes & items" tab, not a
separate tab, and not even a separate section within it: clusters render as rows in the
*same* tree as codes, not beside it. The "New" form's second option creates a cluster
instead of a code; a cluster row sits as a sibling of root codes; and a code filed under a
cluster (drag it onto the cluster row) renders as that cluster's child, with its own
sub-codes nested beneath it exactly as they would at the root — a code has one place in the
tree at a time, cluster membership or plain code-hierarchy position, and dragging it
anywhere (another cluster, another code, back out to the root) moves it cleanly out of
wherever it was. Clusters can nest into each other the same way. Since this tree reads and
writes the exact same `data.categories`/`data.codes` the board does, there's no separate
sync step — dragging in this tree *is* dragging on the board, just via a list instead of a
canvas, and a change from either place is visible in the other immediately because it's one
underlying record, not two views kept in agreement by a mechanism that could fall out of
sync. Analysis still has its own Clusters tab for full membership management (notes,
quotes, AQA question/theme kind) — same `ClustersView` component, same data. (The separate
`NoteCategoryDef` concept — Note Descriptive/Linguistique/Conceptuelle classification tags
— intentionally keeps the word "category": a genuinely different thing, a flat per-note tag,
not a grouping cluster.)

Fixed: dragging a cluster frame on the board stopped carrying its member items along.
Cause — a member that had only ever appeared as a "virtual" (not-yet-persisted) fallback
card, e.g. because it was added to the cluster from the codebook tab rather than physically
dragged into the frame, has no real `BoardItem` for `moveItem` to update, so the move
silently no-op'd and the item snapped back to its grid fallback position afterward. Fixed by
materializing every member into a real `BoardItem` the moment a cluster-drag starts, the
same way a lone card already materializes on its own mousedown.
